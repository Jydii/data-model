# data-model

The proposed data model is for a Technical Academy case study. 

The proposed model is shown using an entity relationship diagram, drawn using the oracle data modeler tool. The relational diagram is engineered from the entity relationship diagram and the data definition language script is generated. 

To test the efficiency of this model, data is collected from the List of Names Dataset (Back4App, 2020) and the University of Wolverhampton website (Wlv.ac.uk, 2018). 

This data is inserted into each table and five queries that exhibit a join, aggregate function, selection, subquery and sorting of data are tested on it. 

The Technical Academy documentation is concluded with a short discussion on data governance rules in a university environment like the Technical Academy.
